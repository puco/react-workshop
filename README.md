React.js Workshop
====================================

You will need

```
git clone https://github.com/sejoker/react-workshop.git
cd react-workshop
npm install
npm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080.

This runs the webpack dev server, any changes you make to javascript
files in `excercises` will cause the browser to reload live.
